# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) 
## Overview

**Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** is a fully managed Kubernetes service on Google Cloud Platform. It enables you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes, while Google automates much of the underlying infrastructure management. GKE is designed for reliability, scalability, and security, making it suitable for a wide range of workloads and industries.

## Key Features

- **Managed Control Plane**: Google handles the Kubernetes control plane, including upgrades, security patches, and high availability.
- **Automated Node Management**: Nodes (VMs) are provisioned, scaled, and repaired automatically, especially in Autopilot mode.
- **Autoscaling**: Supports horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling, as well as cluster autoscaling to match resource demand.
- **Integrated Security**: Features like IAM, RBAC, network policies, and GKE Sandbox provide robust security and isolation.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Built-in integration with Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring for real-time observability.
- **Persistent Storage**: Supports persistent volumes, claims, and integration with Google Cloud Persistent Disks.
- **Flexible Modes**: Offers Standard (user-managed nodes) and Autopilot (fully managed nodes) modes.
- **Seamless Google Cloud Integration**: Connects with VPC, Cloud Load Balancing, Artifact Registry, and other GCP services.

## GKE Architecture

| Component         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster**       | Group of nodes (VMs) managed as a single unit for running containers         |
| **Node**          | Compute Engine VM that runs container workloads                              |
| **Pod**           | Smallest deployable unit, can contain one or more containers                 |
| **Control Plane** | Managed by Google, handles scheduling, scaling, and cluster state            |
| **Node Pool**     | Group of nodes with identical configuration                                  |
| **Service**       | Exposes a set of pods as a network service                                   |
| **Ingress**       | Manages external access to services in the cluster                           |

## How GKE Works

- **Cluster Creation**: Create clusters via Google Cloud Console, CLI, or API.
- **Deployment**: Package applications as containers and deploy as pods.
- **Scaling**: GKE automatically scales pods and nodes based on resource usage.
- **Upgrades**: GKE manages Kubernetes version upgrades for both control plane and nodes.
- **Networking**: Built-in load balancing, VPC integration, and network policies for secure communication.
- **Persistent Storage**: Use persistent disks and storage classes for stateful workloads.

## Modes of Operation

| Mode       | Control Plane Management | Node Management                | Use Case                                      |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Standard   | Managed by GKE          | User-provisioned and managed  | Full control over node configuration           |
| Autopilot  | Fully managed by GKE    | Nodes provisioned/scaled automatically | Minimal operational overhead, focus on workloads |
